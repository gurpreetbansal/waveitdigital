Due to the statue of limitations in terms of divulging patient's information people can come across of certain things such as...life Insurance in the event of death, when the event hits a family. In the time of need we had to cover our own burial expenses because we were unaware that my father didn't have one and he happened to stop with his life Insurance because it was his decision on one time or moment in his life. We had to rely on the GPA\/state burial assistance from DHS due to the promptness of the situation. Maybe this \"highlights\" can serve as a improvement or as a add on into their services. Also we weren't told about one or asked of any life Insurance of their own if they had one or happen to have one during my father's staying at the program when he was alive. Disappointed. \ud83d\ude12","rating":"TWO","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-03-25T12:20:02.773Z","update_time":"2019-03-25T12:20:02.773Z","review_id":"AbFvOql90046QVJpx73KQe0uFxihlL7nmTgkyGuiCdn2GhXokJjevX56u9M4-tj2kN920czWNeSuzw","reviewer_display_name":"Jenn Wood","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJwADA3IQyQ4KiLyAP4Y_sOC-2gjLuJHOaIwGZvQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2019-02-21T13:22:14.628Z","update_time":"2019-02-21T13:22:14.628Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmVJrNU8ZFfsgrmng7yVzpc9ICMQnOEkWG1FxnLHckSIBKk9tBhJg5ghFWKmLMuhAKHm_7UZw","reviewer_display_name":"Ana Karina Gomez Cepeda","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJyzTT8TExSYsa5kbD6Yc01UEU9kgO9OdjHKiu08=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Great place for the erderly population","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2017-06-21T17:24:20.107Z","update_time":"2017-06-21T17:24:20.107Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmKYF4gvpevUB7iZ7s086Wp6cTYjE5PeBg0GiOrhYFySxS2qZZmYYeYnjaIRsGFxJ08uUm0","reviewer_display_name":"Kat Norville","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GgVzvI9T8nL2ZOCRykvlNl2LtP8Rq2ni-xRS5Pi=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FOUR","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""}]}

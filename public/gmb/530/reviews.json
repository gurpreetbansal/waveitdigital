We have loved pretty much every meal.\n\nWe love to cook but just lack the time and energy, and with the pandemic we try not to go to the grocery stores as often so we can't always have fresh produce to cook with. We ended up eating out at restaurants multiple meals a day and spending a ton of money. We started ordering from Chef B's. They offer large portions and most meals are pretty healthy (even if we have a semi-unhealthy meal, it's still better than what we were eating before!). We have ordered breakfast, snacks and dinner. We like the dinners the most, and I order some lunch portions for lunch or sometimes order dinner to split into lunch and dinner because they are so big.\n\nDelivery occurs Sundays, usually first thing in the morning for us. We haven't had an issue with any order so far.\n\nThank you so much Chef B for making our lives so much easier!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Awww thank you so much!

I've tried other services in the past, but ChefB beats them all. They are a little more pricey then their competitors but definitely worth it for the quality, flavor and portion of the food. They list their Macros on their food\/website, which is great when trying to count Macros, and their portion size fits the description... when they say you get 8oz of steak... you get 8oz of steak (I weighed it myself).

Bryan had me figured out just by talking to me. Perfect meals the way I like it. Good size portions, fresh, delivered in a timely fashion. Why do I need to wait in a restaurant and get  served by someone who doesn\u2019t know me? I do not like waiting to get seated especially during snowbird season where the wait can be almost an hour. Chef B meals change by the week and the way he adds his special touch is unreal. After workouts and a shower I go to the refrigerator and get my gourmet healthy meal.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you so much!

I think the Chicken Parm was $14 for the dinner portion and it was enough to completely fill 2 people. Same with the korean chicken thighs... it fed 2 of us and I still had leftovers for a snack.\nI can see this as a good alternative to take out and I don't have the skill set or desire to prepare meals of this caliber. 5 stars!

There is so much to choose from.\nPortions are great, prices are reasonable, and the food  is much better than restaurants!!\nThe chef also makes fabulous desserts.\nThe delivery is great as well!!\nI am happy to support this wonderful small, local business!!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you so much!

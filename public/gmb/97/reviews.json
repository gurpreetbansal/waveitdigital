We have loved pretty much every meal.\n\nWe love to cook but just lack the time and energy, and with the pandemic we try not to go to the grocery stores as often so we can't always have fresh produce to cook with. We ended up eating out at restaurants multiple meals a day and spending a ton of money. We started ordering from Chef B's. They offer large portions and most meals are pretty healthy (even if we have a semi-unhealthy meal, it's still better than what we were eating before!). We have ordered breakfast, snacks and dinner. We like the dinners the most, and I order some lunch portions for lunch or sometimes order dinner to split into lunch and dinner because they are so big.\n\nDelivery occurs Sundays, usually first thing in the morning for us. We haven't had an issue with any order so far.\n\nThank you so much Chef B for making our lives so much easier!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Awww thank you so much!

But there is the macaroni and cheese that I would love to try....maybe after another 10 lbs, I'll go for it.  I cannot say enough good things about this new find.  We've been ordering 6 meals a week for about 10 weeks now.  And another thing, we look so forward to see what is new on the menu each week.

I've tried other services in the past, but ChefB beats them all. They are a little more pricey then their competitors but definitely worth it for the quality, flavor and portion of the food. They list their Macros on their food\/website, which is great when trying to count Macros, and their portion size fits the description... when they say you get 8oz of steak... you get 8oz of steak (I weighed it myself). I typically get 2 Dinner portions for an entire day of eating, and my girlfriend can make 1 dinner portion last 2-3 days.

This was my first time ordering from a home meal delivery service and I was very impressed. The Chicken Parm was delicious and the portions were huge.

I think the Chicken Parm was $14 for the dinner portion and it was enough to completely fill 2 people. Same with the korean chicken thighs... it fed 2 of us and I still had leftovers for a snack.\nI can see this as a good alternative to take out and I don't have the skill set or desire to prepare meals of this caliber. 5 stars!

Meals By Chef B is the best so far.  The meals are delicious and flavorful. No bland tasteless dishes. Unlike some other plans, you have the choice of old favorites and new selections each week to choose between.  You can personalize keto choices or other diet plans, or just go with what you like.  You can order as many meals as you want as opposed to committing to a set number each week.  I also love the fact that you can order lunch size portions or dinner portions and even kids meals. You can also change some sides or choose zoodles instead of noodles with some dishes.  The flexibility is a wonderful feature of Chef B's which I have not found with other meal plans. Meals are delivered fresh weekly by a friendly delivery person.  This plan has the most variety, the best value and tasty variety.  I'm hooked!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"Thank you Gale!!

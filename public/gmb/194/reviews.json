Our turkey chili is slow cooked on the stove top for a minimum of 2 hours and brought well above the 165 degree temperature threshold. As for the gym delivery situation, during the pandemic we have lost a number of partnered gyms from closures. The one in particular you are referring to actually switched owners at some point over the last couple months and we were never alerted. The gym owner told you, that we didn\u2019t deliver there anymore but we had never been informed. When you called us looking for your order I immediately contacted our driver. I called back right away and mentioned that he was slightly behind and suggested as a courtesy to you that he could veer off his route and meet you on your way back home as to not make you wait. Your response was I don\u2019t like to drive and asked to cancel your order. I happily did this right then and thought we had rectified the situation.","reply_update_time":"2021-04-28T09:37:05.248Z"},{"create_time":"2021-04-24T16:00:35.252Z","update_time":"2021-04-24T16:00:35.252Z","review_id":"AbFvOqnzXtz-R-LaQRWc_kmpFygZqom_aXxKpKgCMp3iQjPIjgNt9lt-bASrP9PHoW-b8zsPKW8s","reviewer_display_name":"Alicia Roldan","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GiT1rTI2ZOKGyjatS6V4wtEnF2vs2-g49jUA9IUmw=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-04-21T11:41:44.993Z","update_time":"2021-04-21T11:41:44.993Z","review_id":"AbFvOql4_mYQZcgvMmZD5rZZMCc9-hLj_hVJET46G_CdBkH7A-F8pQzzxMI7-PUvWajGexvfRnbC-g","reviewer_display_name":"Kerry petrello","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJzPKXjSDBR3cuE_sBD7USmpzSaQ-tecYlxKFYI=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":null,"rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-04-18T13:25:36.251Z","update_time":"2021-04-18T13:25:36.251Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlDKjWdLxRibNT48ijHgY1RecSniV8jvSqFY4IdsFuRn3oDNFbKtz_fPkJZfj_6-Ri2YCHZ","reviewer_display_name":"Amie M","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJwb6GAyY1Pn2Ozw2CmgSQxSVt7Qi6bTEExgXwU_=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Delicious food at a great price!","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-04-07T15:37:42.247Z","update_time":"2021-04-07T15:37:42.247Z","review_id":"AbFvOqmBgB_ThyOmMHQHoupVWZRyn7wC0Ga3lB9pVbvIqs_Ag9bEN7UlVVLzblBXIxpZZN7S9HUx","reviewer_display_name":"Jennifer Britton","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GgUlrHrrjHs6vjE1s8SJ_TJwGAwzPukoIatcANMxQ=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"We love ordering meals from edibolic kitchen.

It's beyond Blue Apron, Plate It, etc. All food is prepared fresh, organic when available, customizable, and NOT frozen. No preparation required like the others. Just heat and serve. No defrosting. Combine with a salad and soup, and it's a super easy way to get low sodium, low\/no sugar, complex carbs and lean high protein into one's diet. With nearly zero effort. For me, this business is a godsend. I eat super healthy with little effort. And my last blood chem report seems to support this. In the beginning, Josh actually sat down with me and discussed my specific nutritional needs. Super helpful. Give them a try. No meal plans where you must buy so many meals. Order a few meals, and if you're not happy, there's no further obligation! Now it's easy to take a small nutritious meal to the office, toss into the microwave and still eat very well.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2021-03-21T14:20:32.358Z","update_time":"2021-03-21T14:20:32.358Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkGy-9ALbSUn7-7GhWPhLYL8FmEMpnqIIpSE_DRfR9dJMxbOhm1GK6neAZlnHLW0A10lU3i_g","reviewer_display_name":"David Scalia","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GiHhZp6b8r8_3uUYg7TF_7DTa2z0P_N5wZqvAc-=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Incredibly tasty food to the point where I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m actually eating healthy.

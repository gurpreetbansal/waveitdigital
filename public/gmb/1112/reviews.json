I have never had better customer service anywhere, for anything. When I was shopping around for a wrap for my BMW IA, I called several different shops who, of course promised exceptional service. The reason I went with Diamond Auto is that, from the first conversation with Aurian, I could tell they were going to authentically deliver on this claim.  First, I appreciate that they weren\u2019t able to get me in immediately. As a matter fact it took about three weeks before I was able to finally bring my car in and drop it off. Nearly all the other auto salons I called stated that they could take me in right away. This was a little concerning to me wondering why they perhaps didn\u2019t have enough business. That said\u2026 They scheduled me for a very specific time to have a consultation, and ultimately a timeframe to have the work done. Specifically, Aurian, Zach, and Noah were friendly, punctual, forthcoming, and very knowledgeable. During the process of completing the wrap, wheels, and tires, they communicated with me frequently and always made sure that my concerns were addressed. My job dropped when I saw the completed work for the first time.  They presented it to me on their showroom floor and of course made themselves available to answer any questions I had as we did a very comprehensive walk around. Their professionalism didn\u2019t stop with the completion of the vehicle. After several weeks and 1000 walks around the vehicle, I did notice a minuscule bubble in the door wrap, and a small area of wrap on the side view mirror that didn\u2019t have a perfect edge. When I called the shop, they asked me to bring it in as soon as possible and they set all work aside to prioritize my vehicle.  To top it off, I even brought my vehicle to them when I thought there was an issue with my side view mirror cameras that may have been caused during the wrap of the vehicle. Turns out, it wasn\u2019t their doing at all, however, they fixed it at no cost and with a smile on their face. Absolutely unbelievable top-notch customer service.  bringing in $140,000 car for work like this was obviously a bit nerve-racking, but from day one I felt at ease knowing I couldn\u2019t have put my vehicle in better hands. You truly be hard-pressed to find a better.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-11-25T13:49:55.323Z","update_time":"2020-11-25T13:49:55.323Z","review_id":"AbFvOqkfrmgYL8QbiYllpliZFnVjHSOcXSuQUeCLI9TOmklplw2Eh6vtC17Lc9UETHCCutwxJleukg","reviewer_display_name":"Kathleen Wood","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a-\/AOh14GjwbEWKJkgy3a17i1FCw-G4qW_Te73nNKfk73pN=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"This is my first Google review and I'm writing based on the great service (and price) that I received from Kai and the team.

I researched as much as I could and found out that not all tints are the same. My online search led me to Suntek Ceramic Tinting. I was already sold on the product and what it does, I just needed to find an installer that had the customer service and professionalism to win me over and take my money. A quick look at Diamond Auto Salon\u2019s website shows that not only that they work on high end cars, but also that they make sure their online presentation is up to par. Upon requesting a quote, I was immediately contacted via text and was amazed at how responsive they were. A quick ceramic tint job turned into two of my cars tinted. Not only that, but the owner Auri demonstrated his other bread and butter on my 5 year old beat up car, Feynlab\u2019s self healing ceramic coating. The paint of the car looked like it belonged in a junk yard, and Auri and his team revived it to look BETTER than when I had bought it in 2015.\n\nThe product that Diamond Auto Salon offers speaks for itself. What their team does is not only install and have you on your way, they strive to give outstanding customer service, educate\/inform you about every minute detail of the product\/process and ensure that there is no confusion along the way. Auri, along with co-owner Zach, are clearly passionate and driven in what they do and it\u2019s apparent from the moment one visits their shop.\n\nDon\u2019t let their age nor the age of their shop confuse you. At a year old their business has won me over to the point that when I buy my next car, I will drive it directly to them from the dealer to protect my investment. I shopped around before I found my way to them and the difference in all around experience is night and day.\n\nI give my highest recommendation to Auri, Zach and the team at Diamond Auto Salon. If you need top of the line ceramic tinting or your car\u2019s dying paint job revived they are undoubtedly the people to see. They\u2019re extremely approachable, under promise and over deliver and will have you smiling as you drive out after your car\u2019s been pampered.","rating":"FIVE","review_reply":"","reply_update_time":""},{"create_time":"2020-04-26T03:05:36.086Z","update_time":"2020-04-26T03:05:36.086Z","review_id":"AbFvOqlJSEWTH9nlshWzjEApDNpsneilKYJBzfFsm30fTxJRWmzV4ljBscVfUmxaiEWAbaadQDSm","reviewer_display_name":"Faith Cottam","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJxKzdAeDicwT5w6Pv2fllAGnbfoT0M-3KGcPlxl=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"I ran across diamond auto salon while searching for a professional window tint shop.

They seemed to have taken what works at the old job (good customer service and attention to detail) and eliminated all of the other BS associated with other shops that put profits ahead of the customers needs and wishes. I applaud these two kids (I call anyone under 50 a kid) for taking a huge gamble and taking the time, energy and money needed to open up their own shop in an effort to change the norm in the industry and bring it up to a whole other level. The bottom line here is that the owners (Auri and Zach) care deeply and passionately about the service that they provide to their customers! I come from the high end automobile business my whole life and have used at least 10 or so \"customization shops\" in and around the LA basin and even though some of them were GOOD I would rank Diamond Auto Salon GREAT and my top pick for any referrals for anyone looking to make their stock car look waaaaaaay better than factory OEM. Their paint correction\/detail staff are some of the best that I have ever seen and in my case their vinyl wrap guys are some of the best out there as well! As a fellow Yelper I encourage you to go get an estimate from DAS and at least talk to either Aurian or Zach and see for yourself. As you can see from my pics posted I own a Tesla Model S and they did a full custom wrap for me along with a new set of Vossen wheels, the brake calipers wrapped in red and logos! I also liked the fact that Auri tends to underpromise and overdeliver in terms of \"timing\" as they finished my car in record time (and it was the holidays)!

Your Mercedes C300 came out unbelievable with Feynlabs Ceramic Lite package and STEK clear bra protection film and taillight smoke. Oh and dont forget those deep gloss black powdercoated wheels. We hope you enjoy the (pretty much) new ride and thank you again for the business and trust with Diamond Auto Salon. It was very heartwarming to see your jaw dropping reaction to what we did.\n\nThank you again,\nDAS Team","reply_update_time":"2019-06-26T02:54:12.888Z"},{"create_time":"2019-06-21T16:13:12.823Z","update_time":"2019-06-21T16:13:12.823Z","review_id":"AbFvOqk6sjBWweYPduFMHObAN6Qu2TlMG4Nqc6jdXv4aZMkc-ZT39ieCRJq1bJZ37--5R3ZT9QXyNA","reviewer_display_name":"Mark Peters","reviewer_profile_photo":"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/a\/AATXAJw5PNVnJcFi4OuYXzOl0tJKqaJRptW1sgzHfoFh=s120-c-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-br100","is_anonymous":null,"comment":"Solid group over here, I stopped in for a broken windshield and they took care of it all!

I even received a link that gave me access to my invoice, and if they sent any updates it would notify me over text which I thought was so cool! I got a text about an hour later that my car was ALREADY finished !!!! I have never been to an auto shop of any kind that treated me so well, has such great prices, and such amazing work! Before they could even give me my keys I booked a full ceramic coat to be completed in the same week. They fit me into the schedule and let me drop off my car when it was most convenient for me. Earlier I received update pictures and I am blown away. My paint looks better than it did coming out of the dealership!! So again, I booked ANOTHER service for a windshield tint this coming week! Diamond Auto Salon can officially say they have a customer for a lifetime!

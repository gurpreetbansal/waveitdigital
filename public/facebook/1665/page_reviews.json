{"20131030":{"recommendation":"positive","review_text":"Having had family and friends work for Cityscape Painting and knowing the integrity and attention to detail that Jeff, Scott, Matt, and Mike put into their work I would never hesitate recommending these guys to paint your home.  These guys are great and truly have a passion for taking care of their clients and the employees share the passion by going the extra mile every time to make sure that every ceiling is cut perfect and every splash of color is in the right place on the right wall!","rating":0,"date":"20131030","reviewer":"Anton Korotchuk"}}

                    <h2>Shaping the Future</h2>
                    <p><big>Devallum, founded by Rishabh Khurana, Fernando Gomez and Aadil Farooqi, is an internationally recognized architecture practice with a team of experienced Architects, Designers and Visualizers. Our projects have a variety of range in scale & typology in the field of architecture, interior design and motion graphics. Working closely with each client, we try to understand their vision of the project they are investing in and we enhance & solidify their vision into a new dialect of design. We try to break the existing ontology to create different sets of perceptions depicting the unbending dichotomy of the process with our extensive design workflows for each project.</big></p>
